## How to Play

This Memory Game, also know as Concentration, consists on a deck of cards that are laid face down to hide their pictures.

The deck of cards will be shuffled every time a new game starts.

### Step by Step

* To start the game click on any card in order to flip it over.
* Choose a second card in order to find the first card's match.
* If the two cards match, they will stay facing up. Otherwise they will turn back over.
* Remember what was on each card and where it was.

### Winning the Game

The object of the game is to turn over all the pairs of matching cards.

### Stats

This Memory Game is time based. The faster you find the cards pairs, the better score you will get.
